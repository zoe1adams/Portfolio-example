    <article>
      <p>Working in the emergency department as a medical scribe was one of the most eye-opening experiences in my pre-health journey. Here's what I learned:</p>

      <h3>1. Efficiency is Everything</h3>
      <p>Physicians are constantly multitasking. Learning how to document quickly and accurately was key to keeping up.</p>

      <h3>2. Medical Jargon is a Language</h3>
      <p>From abbreviations to lab terminology, I was immersed in medical language from day one.</p>

      <h3>3. Compassion Comes in Many Forms</h3>
      <p>I saw physicians show care through small gestures, clear communication, and patience—even under pressure.</p>

      <h3>4. Teamwork is Essential</h3>
      <p>The ER thrives on collaboration. Nurses, techs, clerks, and doctors rely on each other more than most people realize.</p>

      <h3>5. Every Case is a Learning Opportunity</h3>
      <p>Whether it was a common cold or a trauma activation, every shift brought something new to learn.</p>
